## Project Description: 

In today's digital age, where computers play a vital role in various aspects of life, typing proficiency is an essential skill. My Typing Master project is an interactive application that aims to improve users' typing skills through three major features: Typing Tutorial, Practice, and Typing Game.

1. Typing Tutorial: The Typing Tutorial feature provides users with a comprehensive introduction to touch typing techniques. It presents interactive lessons that teach proper finger placement, hand positioning, and typing posture. Users will learn the basics of touch typing, including home row keys and finger assignment for each key. The tutorial guides users to improve their typing accuracy and speed.

2. Practice: In the Practice mode, users have the opportunity to improve their typing skills through a series of structured exercises. Users can select different difficulty levels and typing exercises such as word practice, sentence practice, paragraph practice. The application tracks users' progress, including words per minute (WPM) and accuracy, to help them monitor their improvement over time.

3. Typing Game: The Typing Game feature adds a fun and challenging aspect to the learning experience. Users can test their typing speed and accuracy in an exciting game environment. The game displays falling characters that users must type correctly before they reach the bottom of the screen. As users progress, the game's speed and complexity increase, offering a dynamic and engaging way to put their typing skills to the test.
